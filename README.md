My first project for TheOdinProject

"Hey! This is it! My first ever coding project all done. Intially I was very excited to actually begin work on something using prior lesson teachings like making a directory/file, laying the boiler-plate, and using all the elements taught so far. I wondered what stuck and what didn't and to my amazement suprisingly a lot of it stayed with me. One thing that I found myself feeling duirng the project was a desire to learn more about HTML to truly make the website an expression of my creative side, so I was looking up all sorts of elements previously not taught, and then implementing them into my project which only motivated me to really stick to this cirrculum. I write this for my future self to maybe inspire or be a reminder to the fact that this is the start and only the beggining!"
