        <h3>Step-By-Step</h3>
            
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in the pot of an electric pressure cooker 
                (such as Instant Pot) on Sauté mode; add chicken. Cook until browned, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer 
                chicken to a plate, reserving drippings in the pot.</li>
            <li>Place mushrooms, celery, and onion in the pot; cook and stir until soft, 
                about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place chicken back in the pot; add 
                tomatoes and tomato paste. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Top with water and bouillon.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. 
                Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Cook for 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 
                about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid carefully, turning it away from you. Test chicken for doneness; 
                an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season to taste 
                with red pepper flakes and black pepper.</li>
            </ol>
